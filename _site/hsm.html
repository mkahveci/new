<h3 id="other-materials">Other Materials</h3>

<p>You will need an inexpensive calculator having logarithmic (base 10 and base e), expo- nential, and trigonometric functions. Be sure you are familiar with your calculator and that it is in user-ready condition for quizzes and exams. Calculators cannot be shared during exams and the covers must be removed while taking the exam. You are not allowed to have a cell phone during the exam.</p>

<h3 id="zoom-guidelines-and-expectations">Zoom Guidelines and Expectations</h3>

<p>This class will use Zoom for office hours. Students should follow general guidelines and meet participation expectations for Zoom meetings:</p>
