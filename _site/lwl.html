<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>This course covers some fundamentals of chemistry: properties of matter, units and unit conversations, chemical bonding, stoichiometry, thermochemistry. The focus will be on concepts, skills, and abilities needed for success in subsequent chemistry courses. This course is appropriate for non-scientists and science majors with little or no chemistry background, or who need additionally assistance with math concepts.</p>

<h2 id="general-course-objectives">General course objectives</h2>

</ol>

<h2 id="course-specific-learning-outcomes">Course specific learning outcomes</h2>

<p>Successful completion of the course will provide the student with knowledge of the fundamental concepts of chemistry as a preparation for enrollment in General Chemistry I and II.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be familiar with the metric units of measure used in the natural sciences.</li>
  <li>Identify forms of energy and know units in which energy is measured.</li>
  <li>Understand properties of matter and the classes which occur: mixtures, pure chemical substances,
compounds, elements.</li>
  <li>Know chemical symbols for about 50 important elements.</li>
  <li>Understand the nature of changes which occur in matter and their classification as chemical or physical.</li>
  <li>Know about the development of atomic theory and understand the arrangement of protons, neutrons,
and electrons in atoms, and the relative size and mass of atoms.</li>
  <li>Understand how the arrangement of electrons controls the chemical properties of atoms.</li>
  <li>Understand the arrangement of Periodic Table of Elements and be able to predict the properties of
elements based on their location in the table.</li>
