<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>Chemistry 134 is the third course in the three-quarter general chemistry sequence. It is designed to give students a fundamental understanding of chemistry and may be used by non-science majors to fulfill a Scientific Inquiry learning domain requirement in the Liberal Studies Program. The topics covered in Chemistry 134 include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>acid-base equilibria and applications thereof;</li>
  <li>solubility equilibria; thermodynamics;</li>
  <li>electrochemistry; radioactivity; and</li>
  <li>coordination chemistry.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to you gaining an understanding of the topics listed, it is a major goal of this course to develop your problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. You will be given the opportunity to work through problems starting from first principles and challenged to fully understand the meaning of your results. Accomplishing these objectives will require a significant time commitment. <em>You should spend approximately twelve hours per week outside of watching lecture videos working on the material for this course.</em> The bulk of this time should be spent working on problems, including: completing on-line Mastering Chemistry homework assignments, reviewing problems presented in online lectures, and working extra problems suggested from your textbook. Working on problems does not mean that you should read a problem and then immediately look at the solution. This approach will not help you succeed on exams. You should look at the solution to a problem only after you have spent a significant amount of time (15 – 20 minutes) attempting to complete the problem on your own.</p>
