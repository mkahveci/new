Last week's release of the federal government's [STEM Education Strategic Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/STEM-Education-Strategic-Plan-2018.pdf) specifically calls for more blended STEM learning practices across learning landscapes, and cites Connected Science Learning as an online community resource that "shares effective practices and research for bridging the gap between in-school and out-of-school settings" (see page 13 of the report).

This month, CSL ([Issue 8, Part 3](http://csl.nsta.org)) concludes its focus on STEM Learning Through Afterschool Experiences. Find out how The Franklin Institute integrated STEM learning across afterschool, home, and community for underserved children. Learn about Maryland's STEMbassador Learning Community, which supports connected learning experiences that engage youth. Also, read "Global Soundscapes" to learn how you can raise youths' awareness of their acoustic surroundings and discover how a new field is addressing environmental problems through the lens of sound.
