D2L uses specific terms to refer to different parts of the Discussions area, including the following:

* __Forums__ are used to house discussion topics that are similar. For example, there might be several discussions in the first week of the course, so create a forum titled "Week One Discussions" for them. 
* __Topics__ are where the discussion actually takes place. This is where students can post threads in response to a discussion prompt. 
* __Threads__ are the initial comments added to a discussion topic. 
* __Replies__ are responses posted to a specific discussion thread. 

Setting up a discussion is a two-step process: first create a forum that can hold one or more discussion topics, then create discussion topics within that forum.

## Create a Discussion Forum

1. Select Discussions in the course navigation bar.
2. Select the New button.
3. Select New Forum from the dropdown menu.
4. Enter a title [A] (required).
5. Enter a description [B] (optional).
6. Select the Save and Close [C] button.
