Useful tools for online teaching.

<!--more-->

* [Padlet](https://padlet.com/) (free). You open a pad and then double click to add a “post-it” note.  There are different ways to format where all posts go in a line down the center or they can be anywhere (and then moved by the instructor or students if you give permission).
* [Powtoon](https://www.powtoon.com/home/). You can make animations, videos, and infographics.
* [Screencastify](https://www.powtoon.com/home/). Make awesome videos and presentations.
