This tutorial demonstrates how to set up a `Submission` folder with commenting capabilities and with an associated rubric for assessment. The rubric will be tied to the `Grades` module so that the rubric-based assessment  is automatically translated to an associated grade.  

## New  Folder in Submissions with Annotation Tools

* Navigate to `Submissions` > `New Folder`

* `A`: Give a name to the folder. e.g. Lab 1.
* Select a `Grade Item` from the dropdown list. You can add `New Grade Item`, if needed.
* Click `Add Rubric` button and select a rubric from the list. If you don't see a rubric, you need to [import](/ydt#rubric) one.

* Make sure that `Annotation Tools` is checked. This is very important if you want to open the files submitted (without downloading) and give feedback.  

## Importing a Rubric 
{: #rubric }

### Method 1: Copying from my Course

You may import rubrics like any other components in D2L. I will be posting rubrics for SQ20-CHE 133 and SQ20-CHE 135 this quarter. To import a rubric:

* Go to `Course Administration` > `Import Components` 
* Select `Search for offering`
    * Type `CHE_135_901_1050` in the search box to import a rubric for `CHE 135`
    * Type `CHE_133_303_1050` in the search box to import a rubric for `CHE 133`

* `Select Components` and then check `Rubrics` to import.
* Wait for copying and done!

### Method 2: Importing as an External ZIP File

This method is for those who cannot import from my course. Originally, I did not think this would be a problem but I was notified that it was not possible to import a component from my course unless you were enrolled as a TA or instructor.

* First, grab the rubric file as a ZIP from the shared Box folder. 
  * In this folder, navigate to `Online Rubrics to Import D2L` folder. 
  * Any of these files must be imported to D2L as a ZIP file. So, don't unzip. Naming convention:
    * e.g. `SQ20-CHE133-lab-1-online-rubric-to-import-as-ZIP-file.zip` 
    * e.g. `SQ20-CHE135-lab-1-online-rubric-to-import-as-ZIP-file.zip`
* On D2L, go to `Course Administration` > `Import Components` > `Import Components` (again as submenu) and select and upload the ZIP file you grabbed.
* Wait for copying and done!
