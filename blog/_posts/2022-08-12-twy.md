> Good morning! This is Shaan. I wanted to email you for the great experience in the summer semester. I want to thank you for answering my questions always and being understanding of my situation at times as well. You taught very well, and I hope I can be in your classroom again soon or reach out to you soon. I will be updating you with my endeavors and how I do in the rest of college. Thanks!
