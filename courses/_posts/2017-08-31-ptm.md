## Course Description

This course is designed to provide laboratory experience to complement the physical chemistry lecture course, CHEM321/421-24A which presents the principles of physical chemistry that govern equilibria and reaction rates in chemical systems. Laboratory experiments will be related to properties of thermodynamic proper- ties of substances, thermochemistry, chemical and phase equilibria, reaction kinetics.
