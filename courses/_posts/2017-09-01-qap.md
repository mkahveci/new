## Course Description

This course is designed to present the principles of physical chemistry that govern equilibria and reaction rates in chemical systems. Topics include first, second, and third law of thermodynamics, chemical equilibrium, phase equilibrium and kinetic theory of gases, reaction kinetics and mechanism.
