## Course Description

Chemistry 321 is not a prerequisite for this class.

Students will be required not only to have taken the calculus prerequisite, but also to have a working knowledge of it. If you have problems remembering the mathematics, review it now before it becomes too late. Read ahead. Ask questions.

We will spend time in class on each chapter working on problems in groups supplied by the instructor. Participation in groups of 2-3 students is required, and 1-2 of the problems will be assigned and turned in the next class period. They will account for 11% of the final grade. (5.5% for 422)

Chem 422 students will have a short paper (5-7 pgs) on an article published in a peer-reviewed journal. The topic should be something covered in class and must meet my approval. The paper is due on the last day of classes.
The course material will closely follow the text, so it is to the students’ advantage to read the text. Students should read the appropriate material before lecture.

Note: exams will closely follow homework assignments, so it is to the students’ advantage to understand the material covered in homework sets.
