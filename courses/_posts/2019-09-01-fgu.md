## Course Description

Chemistry 120 is the first course in the three-quarter general chemistry sequence. It is designed to
give students a fundamental understanding of chemistry. The topics covered in Chemistry 120 include: units and dimensional analysis; atomic structure; the electronic structure of atoms and periodic properties; bonding and molecular structure; stoichiometry; and reactions in aqueous solution.
