## Course Description

CHE 139 is a co-requisite for CHE 138, General Chemistry II. This course, in conjunction with CHE 138, can be used by non-science majors to fulfill a Scientific Inquiry-Lab (SI-Lab) learning domain requirement in the Liberal Studies Program. The virtual laboratory experiments will reinforce material presented in lecture and allow you to explore lecture topics in more detail. Specific learning objectives for each experiment can be found in the laboratory manual. You will be assessed based on your level of preparedness, observations made during the virtual experiments, data analysis, and overall understanding of the experiments. Your results, analysis, and understanding will be presented in laboratory reports. The laboratory is a critical component of your education as a scientist. Because of the importance of the laboratory, if you have two or more laboratory absences for invalid reasons, you will fail this course.
