## Course Description

Chemistry 132 is the second course in the three- quarter General Chemistry sequence. It is designed to give students a fundamental understanding of chemistry and may be used by non-science majors to fulfill a Scientific Inquiry learning domain requirement in the Liberal Studies Program. The topics covered in Chemistry 132 include: thermochemistry; properties of various states of matter, including gases, liquid, solids, and solutions; kinetics of chemical reactions; and basics of chemical equilibrium.
