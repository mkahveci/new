## Course Description

Chem 171 should be taken concurrently with or before Chem 173.

## Textbook and Materials

1. You will need one bound laboratory notebook, such as a National-brand composition book sold in Barnes and Noble or Beck’s bookstore. You will need laboratory goggles and a lab coat. All of which are available at the bookstore.
2. You will need an inexpensive calculator having logarithmic (base 10 and base e), ex- ponential, and trigonometric functions to do routine mole-mass and volumetric calculations associated with this lab.

### Zoom Guidelines and Expectations

This class will use Zoom for office hours. Students should follow general guidelines and meet participation expectations for Zoom meetings:

* Use your given or preferred name as your display name.
* Don’t use distracting or inappropriate profile photos or virtual backgrounds.
* Minimize distractions, such as televisions and cell phones, when possible.
* Try to put your device at eye level on a solid surface. Holding your device or placing it in your lap can
add movement to your video, which can be distracting.
* Don’t engage in other activities during sessions (driving, cooking, cleaning, etc.)
* Mute your microphone when you’re not speaking to minimize background noise.
* Don’t share meeting links, passwords, screenshots, recordings, or other meeting information. with
people outside the class.
* If connectivity issues impact your audio/video quality, try turning off your camera.
* Be on time or notify your instructor if you will be late or unable to attend.
* If you think you might have trouble actively participating in meetings, let your instructor know in
advance, if possible.
* Contact Loyola’s Technology Support Center at (773) 508-4487 or via email at ITS Service Desk
[ITSServiceDesk@luc.edu](mailto:ITSServiceDesk@luc.edu), if you need assistance during a video call.
