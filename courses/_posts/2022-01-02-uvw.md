## Course Description

The course further develops basic chemical principles from CHEM 101 and requires in- depth integration of concepts. Multiple perspectives of matter will be used to describe and explain characteristics, properties, and relationships across the following topics: liquids and solids, solutions, reaction kinetics, equilibria, acids and bases, reaction thermodynamics, electrochemical reactions.

Students will deepen their understanding of foundational concepts of chemistry and advance their skills in scientific problem solving, critical thinking and synthesis of concepts.

These may include applications that convert photos to pdfs (examples: CamScanner, Scannable, GeniusScan), collaboration materials for group work (examples: JamBoard, OneNote), testing-related software approved by the University (example: Respondus Browser), and others.

### Zoom Guidelines and Expectations

This class will use Zoom for office hours. Students should follow general guidelines and meet participation expectations for Zoom meetings:

* Use your given or preferred name as your display name.
* Don’t use distracting or inappropriate profile photos or virtual backgrounds.
* Minimize distractions, such as televisions and cell phones, when possible.
* Try to put your device at eye level on a solid surface. Holding your device or placing it in your lap can
add movement to your video, which can be distracting.
* Don’t engage in other activities during sessions (driving, cooking, cleaning, etc.)
* Mute your microphone when you’re not speaking to minimize background noise.
* Don’t share meeting links, passwords, screenshots, recordings, or other meeting information. with
people outside the class.
* If connectivity issues impact your audio/video quality, try turning off your camera.
* Be on time or notify your instructor if you will be late or unable to attend.
* If you think you might have trouble actively participating in meetings, let your instructor know in
advance, if possible.
* Contact Loyola’s Technology Support Center at (773) 508-4487 or via email at ITS Service Desk
[ITSServiceDesk@luc.edu](mailto:ITSServiceDesk@luc.edu), if you need assistance during a video call.
